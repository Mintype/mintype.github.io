# Portfolio Website
## Just a website I'm working on.

Hey there! I decided to make a website for the first time!
I mainly know *Java*, because of my Computer Science class in school.
Making a website has been something of a struggle to me,
as I needed to learn *html*, *css*, and ofcourse *javascript*.
