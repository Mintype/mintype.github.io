# Portfolio Website
## Just a website I'm working on.

Hey there! I decided to make a website for the first time!  
I mainly know *Java*, because of my Computer Science class in school.  
Making a website has been something of a struggle to me,  
as I needed to learn *html*, *css*, and ofcourse *javascript*.  


3/16/24: I am recreating this page from scratch. I really am looking forward to improving its aesthetics and completion in general.
